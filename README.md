# gutenborg
A json REST api for Project Gutenburg's book metadata.

I am not associated with Project Gutenburg, nor does this repository
provide the data for using this code.  See 
[http://www.gutenberg.org/feeds/catalog.marc.bz2](http://www.gutenberg.org/feeds/catalog.marc.bz2)
if you want to download the relevant file.

This is definitely a work in progress. 

Project Gutenberg stores book metadata in MARC format, which is useful for
libraries, less so for developers. This aims to free it.  Links to, and
usage of that data may be subject to the policies and licenses of Project Gutenburg,
relevant intellectual property laws for your area.
